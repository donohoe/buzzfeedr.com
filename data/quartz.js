HBO might then reach customers outside of the roughly 100 million US households that currently pay for cable TV service. Someone might pay monthly fees of $20 for a basic personal subscription, $10 for HBO, $8 for Netflix, and $2 for some newfangled YouTube channel&mdash;a scenario that&rsquo;s closer to an \u003Cem\u003E&agrave; la carte\u003C\/em\u003E media menu.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EOn-demand that&rsquo;s not awful\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople want easier and more personal access to video, which is one way to explain the success of Hulu. Much of Hulu&rsquo;s content is also available to pay TV subscribers through on-demand menus, but those interfaces are so poorly designed that people avoid them or don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s available. Hulu is easy to use. HBO Go is easy to use. Netflix is easy to use.

Well, many more overseas affiliates of emerging-market companies now have access to foreign bond markets than did in 1997. After 2008, when the US Federal Reserve began its first program of quantitative easing (QE)&mdash;depressing US interest rates in an attempt to juice the economy&mdash;these companies were able to borrow in &ldquo;hard currencies&rdquo; like the US dollar or euro at rates much lower than those they could get back home.\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"inline-ad\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBofA\/ML flags the BRIC countries as having some of the more worrisome of these &ldquo;hard currency&rdquo; debt problems.

Say a Russian company issues debt in dollars; if the ruble loses value against the dollar, the company will end up owing more than it borrowed, in ruble terms.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there&rsquo;s the question of what all this is invested in. Some went into overseas assets like mines or oilfields. Those are fairly insulated from big currency fluctuations.&nbsp;But a decent chunk is likely in more volatile stuff like emerging-market stocks and property. As the Fed tapers, sucking dollars out back out of emerging markets, the value of those assets could plummet. And those assets are the underlying collateral of debt owed to overseas bond investors.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, BofA\/ML worries that \u003Ca title=\"Get ready: a large portion of China&rsquo;s $1.8 trillion in trust products may be headed for default this year\" href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/176968\/get-ready-a-large-portion-of-chinas-1-8-trillion-in-trust-products-may-be-headed-for-default-this-year\/\"\u003EChina&rsquo;s enormous trust loan sector\u003C\/a\u003E, a crucial off-balance-sheet lending channel, is partly funded by overseas debt issuances. And a recent \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/qtrpdf\/r_qt1309.pdf\"\u003EBank of International Settlements paper\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;(pdf, p.23) found that&nbsp;China&rsquo;s property firms have taken out more foreign-currency loans than its oil and gas companies have, even though the oil and gas sector has much more reason to be shopping for offshore investments.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"qz-inline-image alignnone\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/bis_dollar-den-debt-issued-china.png?w=640&amp;h=735\" class=\"size-medium_10\" data-retina=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/bis_dollar-den-debt-issued-china.png?w=640&amp;h=735\" alt=\"\" title=\"&#8203;\"\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"caption\"\u003E&#8203;\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"credit\"\u003EBank of International Settlements\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the taper does prompt emerging-market assets to drop in value, those countries will need more money flowing into their financial systems. They could do this by, for example, upping trade surpluses (exporting more\/importing less), privatizing, opening up equity markets to more foreign investment&mdash;or simply by having their central banks kick up their lending. The only worry is, that might encourage their companies to rack up even more debt.\u003C\/p\u003E",

Guess.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story: A little over a week ago at a public school in Sterling, Connecticut, an elderly man came to pick up his 5-year-old great grandson, a kindergartener. It was cold out, the boy had his hat pulled low over his head, great-gramps scooped him up and drove him home. Only problem:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn&rsquo;t the right kid.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was another 5-year-old who wore the same kind of hat pulled down low. When gramps got home and the boy refused to get out of the car, great-grandma came out and realized&mdash;what in tarnation?\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn another era, she might&rsquo;ve beaned her husband with a frying pan. But this is the era when every interaction between a child and adult who is not background checked or biologically related is assumed to be fraught with pedophile potential. &nbsp;Just in the last few days,&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.wkrn.com\/story\/24851518\/franklin-man-http:\/www.wkrn.com\/story\/24851518\/franklin-man-misunderstandingmisunderstanding\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Epolice were on the lookout for a Franklin, Tennessee\u003C\/a\u003E, man who&rsquo;d offered two girls a ride, even as&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.leaguecity.com\/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1320\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ecops in League City, Texas, hunted for an 87-year-old\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;who&rsquo;d offered to help a boy who looked locked out. Both men were quickly cleared &ndash; they were actual good Samaritans&mdash;but not before the police warned citizens of a possible predator on the loose.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, the great-grandparents knew exactly what to do. They immediately called the school to alert them to the problem and drove the kid right back. The school, in turn, called the mom to tell her what just happened. This was the first she was hearing about the incident, so she found out her son was safe at exactly the same time she found out about the mix-up. So you&rsquo;d think that would be the end of it, right? No harm, no foul?\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease. The outraged mom demanded the school call in the police and child protective services. The school&mdash;god bless it&mdash;demurred: The kid hadn&rsquo;t been hurt, it was just a mistake. What&rsquo;s more, this wasn&rsquo;t some evil stranger running in and snatching a child, it was an old man with his own kin at the school who&rsquo;d made a hat-induced error.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"inline-ad\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course, next thing you know, there&rsquo;s an education board meeting and the media are on the story.

(News! The thing that used to report on revolutions and assassinations.)\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe school has now promised it will set up three different pick-up sites for kids. Dismissal, which already involved showing identification and signing a sheet, will become an even bigger production, because that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve been trained to respond to any incident that &ldquo;affects&rdquo; a child: Heap on the oversight.

The government promises to pay locals 21,620 yuan, about $3,500, in exchange for one mu&nbsp;of land, but because Zhang&rsquo;s home and the small bit of farmland they have is less than that, her compensation will likely be lower when she is relocated.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"qz-inline-image alignfull\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/01\/zhang-chunlian-web.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=691\" width=\"1024\" height=\"691\" class=\"size-full\" data-retina=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/01\/zhang-chunlian-web.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=691\" alt=\"\" title=\"Zhang Chunlian has been waiting for news of when and where her family will be relocated for almost 20 years.\"\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"caption\"\u003EZhang Chunlian has been waiting for news of when and where her family will be relocated for almost 20 years.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"credit\"\u003EQuartz\/Lily Kuo\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZhang&rsquo;s experience isn&rsquo;t unique.&nbsp;According to Mei Ji, a resident of nearby Shiyan and author of a book titled&nbsp;\u003Ci\u003ESending Water North,\u003C\/i\u003E&nbsp;between 1992 and 2005, when the SNWDP plans became clear and the&nbsp;project finally got underway, many villages near the reservoir were forbidden from building not just factories that might pollute the water but also things like roads, schools, and hospitals. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve lived in pain and poverty,&rdquo; she told Quartz. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t develop because the diversion project could start at any moment.&rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZhang&rsquo;s village is an example of the fact that local governments are undertaking construction projects related to the SNWDP that require the resettling of even more people.&nbsp;The 47-square-kilometer (18-square-mile) development zone in Danjiangkou is being built over an area that was once home to about 53,000 people.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s unclear how many are actually being relocated; Quartz spoke to residents who said their village of about 30 families had been moved to make way for a highway for the development zone.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA downstream city called Xiangyang is undergoing a similar urban overhaul that is uprooting residents.

The most responsible companies look perhaps two or three steps down, supply-chain responsibility experts say.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010, Apple&rsquo;s reliance on this mostly-foreign supply chain led to the worst public-relations scandal in its history: A \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/06\/07\/business\/global\/07suicide.html?pagewanted=all\"\u003Espate of worker suicides\u003C\/a\u003E highlighted the conditions at Chinese factories run by Foxconn (a.k.a. Hon Hai), the Taiwanese manufacturing giant. No matter that Apple wasn&rsquo;t the only company that hired Foxconn to build its products&mdash;HP and Dell do too, among others&mdash;success made it a target, as customers began to ask where their magical devices came from.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis forced Apple to begin a long process of&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/27\/business\/signs-of-changes-taking-hold-in-electronics-factories-in-china.html?pagewanted=1\"\u003Eimproving how it monitors its supply chain\u003C\/a\u003E.&nbsp;In 2006, the first year it began auditing suppliers, Apple looked at 11 factories and didn&rsquo;t have a program to train suppliers in its labor standards; in 2011 it visited 229 and had trained 1.5 million managers and workers. By 2012, Foxconn pledged to end the 100-hour work-week and adopt some minor wage hikes.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same year that Foxconn&rsquo;s suicides became news, Apple discovered 91 underage workers in the factories making its products. Forty-two of them were found at a single facility in China that had partnered with a vocational school which forged hiring papers. You can see how it drove up the numbers in the chart above. Apple promptly stopped doing business with the company and reported it to the government.&nbsp;A similar incident contributed to an even bigger spike in 2012 (more on that in a bit).\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThink of the children\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut firing the supplier was clearly not enough, given the questions the company was facing. Its executives decided to adopt a program designed in 2008 by Impactt, a social-responsibility consultancy based in the UK that operates in China, India, and Bangladesh. The plan calls for Apple to make any transgressing supplier pay not only for the education of any child laborers it is found using, but also keep paying them wages\u003Cstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\/strong\u003Euntil they graduate (thus removing their incentive to stay out of school). Apple follows up with the former workers to ensure they are still in school.\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to deter suppliers from hiring children, while making sure any they do hire end up back in school. Dionne Harrison, who manages these programs for Impactt, says her local staff go to the factory to meet the workers, figure out their actual age and, eventually, meet their families, in an effort to convince them to go back to school.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like a good deal. Yet most of the time, the young workers don&rsquo;t take it.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EA 34% participation rate\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple executives declined to discuss their child labor policies with us or say how many underage workers have entered the remediation program, which a spokesperson confirmed began in 2010. Impactt manages Apple&rsquo;s program along with those of two other companies; in&nbsp;its \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.impacttlimited.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/Impactt-15th-anniversary-report_finding-the-sweet-spot.pdf\"\u003Emost recent report\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;(pdf), the consultancy said only 34% of the child workers offered the chance to participate in the program&nbsp;in 2011 went back to school.&nbsp;Harrison says the participation rate is about the same today.&nbsp;Before 2011, it was even lower; from 2006 to 2010, only 60 of 330 children found working in factories in China, India, Turkey, Vietnam and Bangladesh returned to education.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"inline-ad\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not take the stipend and the schooling? Sometimes, by the time auditors discover a worker was hired as a child, she is already of working age. Other times, the underage laborers don&rsquo;t like school and prefer to work. But there&rsquo;s also the rising pressure to earn more money. In China, as the economy grows with more and more foreign production, the cost of living has in the last decade started rising faster than wages. &ldquo;In terms of workers feeling the pinch, they feel it much more now than they&rsquo;ve ever done before in China,&rdquo; Harrison says.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThe problem of child labor\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERising wages have put pressure on manufacturers to move inland, automate, or even get out of the country altogether. But for second- and third-tier suppliers who don&rsquo;t have those options, cheaper labor may be all that&rsquo;s left.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s &ldquo;one of the reasons you see an increasing number of dispatched workers or workers on these so-called internships,&rdquo; Dan Viederman, the CEO of Verite, a consultancy that works with Apple to resolve problems with migrant laborers trafficked into sub-contracted factories. Child laborers can wind up working far from home, as part of the wave&mdash;now gradually receding&mdash;of workers heading from the Chinese heartland to coastal factories.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat&rsquo;s one reason that Asia remains&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/127287\/one-in-ten-kids-globally-are-child-laborers-and-thats-considered-good-news\/\"\u003Ethe world leader in child labor\u003C\/a\u003E&mdash;though there as in other regions, the phenomenon is declining, thanks to industrialization. (Of the one in 10 children around the world who work, most are subsistence farmers.)\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Apple&rsquo;s most public child-labor incident&mdash;and the only one to date where it has named and shamed its supplier&mdash;auditors discovered in 2012 that a company called Guangdong Real Faith Pingzhou Electronics had hired 74 underage workers after a labor agency, Shenzhen Quanshun Human Resources, helped families forge proof-of-age documents for their children. Apple terminated its contract with the supplier, and made the company return the children to their families, as well as offering them its remediation program.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple publicized the case, seeing an opportunity to warn suppliers, improve its public image, and ding competitors. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re not finding [child labor], they&rsquo;re not looking hard enough,&rdquo; Apple&rsquo;s SVP of operations \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2013-01-25\/apple-expands-audits-says-china-labor-agent-forged-documents.html\"\u003Etold Bloomberg last year\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne Apple competitor, Samsung, the largest manufacturer of phone handsets in the world, said&nbsp;it found \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/aboutsamsung\/sustainability\/sustainabilityreports\/2013sustainabilityreport.pdf\"\u003Eno underage workers\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;(pdf) in its factories in 2012. The company didn&rsquo;t respond directly to questions about how it addresses child labor, but it said that because 90% of its parts are made at its own facilities and not outsourced, it can &ldquo;offer world-class working conditions and maintain the facilities in accordance with international labor standards in all regions in which it operates.&rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELabor activists dispute that: In 2012, the NGO China Labor Watch \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.chinalaborwatch.org\/pdf\/Samsung%20Report%200904-v3.pdf\"\u003Efound eight facilities\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;(pdf) either directly owned or contracted by Samsung with significant labor violations, including underage workers and exploited student workers.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThe price of progress\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same activists say it isn&rsquo;t true that conditions for most Chinese workers have improved over the last few years. Apple, says Kevin Slaten, who works at China Labor Watch, is better than its rivals at communicating with the media, NGOs, suppliers and their workers, and he has witnessed its work to return child laborers to school. But China Labor Watch says conditions in the factories still have not improved much, and long hours and unpaid overtime dominate. Such conditions, already harsh for adult workers, are even worse for kids.&nbsp;Last year, a 15-year-old used a fake government ID to get work at a Pegatron factory building Apple&rsquo;s latest iPhone. He \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/12\/11\/technology\/worker-deaths-raise-questions-at-an-apple-contractor-in-china.html\"\u003Edied of pneumonia\u003C\/a\u003E after working 12-hour days, six days a week, well over the legal hour limit for adult workers.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;[Child labor] is&nbsp;relatively low percentage of the labor violations happening in the supply chain, a relatively inexpensive thing to take care of,&rdquo; Slaten says. &ldquo;To pay a million workers unpaid overtime wages, it&rsquo;s going to be a little chunk of their profit margin.&rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple&rsquo;s latest responsibility report says it found 71 facilities underpaying its workers in 2013, and forced them to repay $2.1 million in back wages.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;As far as where the multinational companies fit in this, they are not Chinese themselves, probably don&rsquo;t have Chinese management, but they are taking advantage of the fact that labor enforcement in China has been lax,&rdquo; Slaten says. &ldquo;That there&rsquo;s a governance gap doesn&rsquo;t mean they can profit off it.&rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut multinationals have long profited off loose labor standards in China and other emerging markets, much to \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/127496\/dont-blame-robots-for-americas-falling-wages-blame-trade\/\"\u003Ethe chagrin of manufacturing workers\u003C\/a\u003E in the wealthy economies. The pressure such companies face after tragedies like the Foxconn suicides or last year&rsquo;s collapse of \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/re\/rana-plaza\/\"\u003Ea textile factory in Bangladesh\u003C\/a\u003E means that they sometimes pay a price, but most of the time, the tolerance for systemic labor violations abroad suggests the price isn&rsquo;t too high.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the work those companies create has helped lift millions in China out of poverty. &ldquo;Trade is a good thing, a very good way to redistribute wealth, much more effective than aid,&rdquo; Harrison says. And as people become more prosperous, she says, they&rsquo;re demanding better conditions. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re comparing like with like, conditions are better now [but] expectations are changing, and what workers want from their jobs is also changing. Their perceived quality of job is probably worse now than it used to be.&rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E",

            "content": "\u003Cp\u003ECompanies promote diversity in the workplace as a moral imperative with &ldquo;bottom line benefits.&rdquo;&nbsp;But research on the value of diversity is mixed. Some studies have found diverse teams&mdash;meaning workgroups comprised of employees&nbsp;of different races, genders, and backgrounds&mdash;promote creativity, nurture critical thinking, and tend to make better, more thoughtful decisions because they consider a wider range of perspectives. Other studies indicate diverse teams fuel interpersonal conflicts, reduce cohesion, and slow the pace of learning.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trouble with past research is it assumes only diverse settings are capable of changing how people behave, form impressions, and make decisions. The research has created a convention in which homogeneous groups are considered a &ldquo;control condition.&rdquo; Think, for instance, about how we talk about topics related to diversity&mdash;we ask whether&nbsp;diversity\u003Ci\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003Einfluences perception, decision-making, and performance. When we digest results, we focus on whether&nbsp;diversity\u003Ci\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003Ehelped or hurt, strengthened or weakened, increased or decreased a given outcome. On the other hand, we view the homogeneous condition as a baseline: a reference point from which we can understand how diversity has changed behavior or what type of response is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHomogeneity, however, is not a baseline.&nbsp;My colleagues, Katherine Phillips at Columbia&nbsp;Business School and&nbsp;Jennifer Richeson at Northwestern University, and I recently sampled 240 research articles on group diversity. We found that while the vast majority of&nbsp;research pays no heed to the effects of homogeneity, it may play a profound&mdash;and at times negative&mdash;role in shaping group behavior. Studies show, for instance, that homogeneous groups tend to make oversimplified judgments that can result in over-confident, even objectively inaccurate, decisions.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake, for instance, one study that involved giving case information&mdash;potential clues to solve a murder mystery&mdash;to individuals assigned to either a homogeneous or diverse group. In diverse groups, people&rsquo;s confidence about their group&rsquo;s performance corresponded with how well their group actually performed. That is, diverse groups that identified the correct murder suspect reported higher levels of confidence than diverse groups who did not. People in homogeneous groups, on the other hand, tended to report high levels of confidence&nbsp;irrespective\u003Ci\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003Eof how their group performed. In other words: homogeneous groups were further, not closer, than diverse groups to an objective index of accuracy.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a different study, participants were randomly assigned to all-white or racially diverse juries and asked to deliberate over the same trial. Results revealed that the all-white juries made more factually inaccurate statements and considered a narrower range of information when discussing a trial than did racially diverse juries.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"inline-ad\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy may homogeneous groups be more prone to make less accurate decisions, but feel more confident about them?\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne reason may be that homogeneity leads people to assume that other peoples&rsquo; behavior is more predictable than it actually is. People in homogeneous groups assume that because others look like them, they&nbsp;are&nbsp;like them in terms of having similar perspectives, knowledge, and values. This assumption of like-mindedness&nbsp;feels comfortable. We feel good when we think we&rsquo;re around people like us. It happens in the school cafeteria, at cocktail parties, and also in hiring situations.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that sense of comfort comes at a cost. It creates blind spots in our judgments and decision-making. People in homogeneous groups seem to underestimate the potential for seemingly similar others to have substantively different perspectives, which can lead them to make oversimplified, perhaps even objectively inaccurate, decisions.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s as though homogeneous groups operate on cruise control. Without people who look different, there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;social prompt&rdquo; to snap team members out of their comfort zone and remind people there may be a different way of looking at an issue. Everyone goes on blithely presuming that all others are all thinking the same thing.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s worth noting that the effects associated with homogeneity&mdash;lack of accuracy in processing information and an absence of objectivity in making decisions&mdash; hark back to one of the most widely-popularized phenomenon in the psychology of groups: groupthink. Groupthink scenarios traditionally are characterized as ones in which a group&rsquo;s consensus-seeking tendencies detract from the quality or morality of their decisions. There is a distinct possibility that homogeneity plays an underappreciated role in producing some effects typically ascribed to groupthink.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point isn&rsquo;t that diversity has no effects on behavior. Of course it does. But homogeneity does, too. Much more work remains to be done, but it may be that the strongest business case to be made for diversity in the workplace has less to do with what diversity adds, and more to do with what homogeneity takes away.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWe welcome your comments at&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eideas@qz.com\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E",

Fitness trackers are touted as a wellness tool: something that you&rsquo;ll want to wear all the time, and that will make your life better and healthier. I wanted to see if they were producing data that could actually help me, and just what I could do with that data.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expected to hate all of them, but I was wrong. I also expected them to all be sorts of useless&mdash;and on that count I was right.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went with four of the most popular bands: \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.fitbit.com\/flex?gclid=CLO4_42W_LwCFRQaOgodflMAog\"\u003EThe FitBit Flex\u003C\/a\u003E ($100) (not the newest model, but the \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/help.fitbit.com\/customer\/portal\/articles\/1425569\"\u003EForce has been recalled\u003C\/a\u003E); the \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/jawbone.com\/up?gclid=COvR8LCW_LwCFQ2hOgodgXgAbA\"\u003EJawbone UP24\u003C\/a\u003E ($150); the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.misfitwearables.com\/#home\"\u003EMisfit Shine\u003C\/a\u003E ($120); and the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.mybasis.com\/?utm_source=Basis&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=Basis&amp;gclid=CPuBkYWX_LwCFe87OgodLgcAng\"\u003EBasis\u003C\/a\u003E ($200).\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EWhat I did\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy methodology was fairly straightforward. Every morning I put on all four trackers at once, with the three smaller bands&mdash;FitBit, Jawbone, and Shine&mdash;on my left wrist, and the larger Basis on my right. The Basis claims to be the most sophisticated, and doesn&rsquo;t specify which wrist you should wear it on, so I figured we&rsquo;d be okay. I was, however, prepared to see a higher activity level in the Basis; Since I&rsquo;m right-handed, I figured that tracker would be moving more. (Though not much more, as I spend my days with both hands planted firmly on a keyboard.)\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took all four bands off at night and in the shower. All are water-resistant, but I was less-than-enthused about sudsing up with so many devices on my arm. They also all provide some form of sleep tracking&mdash;but have you ever tried sleeping with four fitness trackers on? I did once, and spent eight hours whacking myself in the face with them.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut other than that, we&rsquo;re talking full-time tracker-wearing.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cform id=\"wpcom-iframe-form-464a99512e282cc8c652ac08d021816e-531a323dc716a\" target=\"wpcom-iframe-464a99512e282cc8c652ac08d021816e-531a323dc716a\" method=\"post\" action=\"http:\/\/wpcomwidgets.com\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"frameborder\" value=\"0\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"scrolling\" value=\"no\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"resize\" value=\"0\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"replace_attributes\" value=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"fallback\" value='&lt;p class=\"protected-embed-fallback\"&gt;This embed is invalid&lt;\/p&gt;'\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"class\" value=\"\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"width\" value=\"612\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"height\" value=\"710\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"_data\" value=\"PGlmcmFtZSBzcmM9Ii8vaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9wL2o1QVdubGtuam4vZW1iZWQvIiB3aWR0aD0iNjEyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjcxMCIgZnJhbWVib3JkZXI9IjAiIHNjcm9sbGluZz0ibm8iIGFsbG93dHJhbnNwYXJlbmN5PSJ0cnVlIj48L2lmcmFtZT4=,b7d4ade2a97acd05510a0ada8508770432908691\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"_tag\" value=\"protected-iframe\"\u003E\u003Cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"_hash\" value=\"464a99512e282cc8c652ac08d021816e\"\u003E\u003C\/form\u003E\u003Ciframe name=\"wpcom-iframe-464a99512e282cc8c652ac08d021816e-531a323dc716a\" width=\"612\" height=\"710\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wpcom-protected-iframe \"\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003Cscript type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E( function() {var func = function() {var iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-464a99512e282cc8c652ac08d021816e-531a323dc716a');if ( iframe ) { iframe.submit(); }}if (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); \/* compat for infinite scroll *\/ }else if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'DOMContentLoaded', func, false ); }else if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }} )();\u003C\/script\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThe data\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was pretty sure that the step counts would be all over the place, and that I&rsquo;d be left wondering why I hadn&rsquo;t just used an old-fashioned pedometer instead. In fact, the step counts were surprisingly consistent across devices&mdash;even the Basis, worn on my dominant hand, stayed remarkably close when I averaged out the results day-to-day. When we spoke to the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/176156\/the-gadgets-and-apps-that-quantified-self-guru-nicholas-felton-uses-to-monitor-his-every-move\/\"\u003Eultimate quantifier, Nicholas Felton\u003C\/a\u003E, about his multiple fitness trackers, he told us that the results were all within &ldquo;around 10% of each other,&rdquo; which he considered an acceptable margin. Sometimes I would look down at my various step counts and guffaw at the wide range the devices showed. But once I had the accumulated numbers in front of me, my results were much the same as Felton&rsquo;s:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignnone size-medium_10 wp-image-184645\" alt=\"Steps-Taken-Basis-Jawbone-FitBit-Shine_chartbuilder (1)\" src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/steps-taken-basis-jawbone-fitbit-shine_chartbuilder-1.png?w=640&amp;h=360\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot every data point worked out so well: Estimated calories burned, for example, were all over the place:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignnone size-medium_10 wp-image-184646\" alt=\"Calories-Burned-Basis-Jawbone-FitBit-Shine_chartbuilder\" src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/calories-burned-basis-jawbone-fitbit-shine_chartbuilder.png?w=640&amp;h=360\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndividual bands were consistent, so they all &ldquo;worked&rdquo; within their own logic, based on whatever algorithms they use. But even though each company claims to use cutting-edge technology, the calorie estimates varied from device to device.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepresentatives from FitBit, Jawbone, and Misfit confirmed that their bands estimate resting caloric burn&mdash;the calories you burn just by sitting around being your bad self&mdash;using your height, weight, age and gender. All three use algorithms informed by their accelerometers to estimate active caloric burn, and the FitBit and Jawbone allow you to enter different types of activity to better inform the burn rate. You might move your body as much while walking down a flat road as you do while hiking up a mountain, but the caloric expenditure will be different.&nbsp;Basis CEO Jef Holove told Quartz that his band uses heart rate, body temperature, and sweat level sensors to determine the intensity of your activity automatically, producing what he believes is the most accurate calorie count on the market.&nbsp;With the Basis, the calorie count was so much higher than average, however, that I was left wondering if I&rsquo;m just especially sweaty.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/playbook\/2012\/08\/fitness-trackers\/\"\u003EWIRED reported in 2012\u003C\/a\u003E, the only way to get an accurate read on calorie burn is with an indirect calorimeter, which analyzes your oxygen consumption using a face mask and costs between $30,000 and $50,000. On the bright side, the five-pound backpack usually used to carry the equipment will make your workout that much more strenuous.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"inline-ad\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line, you can&rsquo;t treat your fitness tracker&rsquo;s calorie count as gospel. Like step count, calorie count is really just meant to be a good estimate. But step counts are a great tool for relative improvement; if an average day has a read of 8,000 steps for you, that number doesn&rsquo;t have to be strictly accurate for you to deduce that increasing that number by half would make you fitter. Bad calorie estimations, on the other hand, could actually derail your fitness plans. If, for example, you&rsquo;re using your calorie readings as an excuse to eat an extra slice of cake&mdash;or as a motivation to deprive yourself of essential sustenance&mdash;stop.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EOther surprises\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I got much more out of the trackers than I thought I would. Wearing them spurred me to be more active throughout the day (insofar as walking to the farthest bathroom stall or a few blocks further for lunch counts as &ldquo;more active&rdquo;). Being tracked made me appreciate just how good for me a day running around town could be (check out my weekend spikes!), as well as just how sedentary I am at work. I did my experiment during a cold week, and I got sick partway through, so I was doing less &ldquo;extra&rdquo; walking than I usually do. Now I know what a lazy week looks like, and it isn&rsquo;t too great. That&rsquo;s useful, even if it&rsquo;s not an insight I&rsquo;d have paid more than $100 for.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EWhich one should you buy?\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of them, in my opinion.&nbsp;For now, the information I got didn&rsquo;t seem worth the money spent. With costs still fairly high, I feel pretty good about waiting a year or so to see what&rsquo;s on the market then.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, wearing four fitness trackers just \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/173443\/how-fitness-monitors-made-me-yearn-for-exactly-the-kind-of-smartwatch-apple-is-supposedly-building\/\"\u003Emade me want a single wearable\u003C\/a\u003E to track my fitness \u003Ci\u003Eand \u003C\/i\u003Edisplay my email. For me, a device that served only to increase my daily steps slightly wasn&rsquo;t worth the money, charging time, or wrist real estate. That being said, each device had its pros and cons:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignnone size-medium_10 wp-image-184701\" alt=\"04_swim_sportband\" src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/04_swim_sportband.jpg?w=640&amp;h=179\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\"\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Misfit Shine\u003C\/b\u003E has a very cool minimalist design, and could be worn anywhere. You can tap the face of it throughout the day to \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3OGXW-FLrI4\"\u003Esee your progress\u003C\/a\u003E, and it serves as a watch as well&mdash;albeit a rather abstract one. Plus, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/store.misfitwearables.com\/products\/misfit-shine\"\u003Eyou can order\u003C\/a\u003E a leather band for it to sit in, which certainly classes it up. Another big bonus to the simplified hardware is that the Shine uses a battery that lasts for months, instead of needing a periodic charge.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with the minimalism of the disc&rsquo;s design, the accompanying app is fairly bare, too. You see your progress towards your daily goal, without the insights or playful nudging that the other devices offer. The information is there, but it feels less gamified than the FitBit and the Jawbone.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, the Shine was actually&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Etoo&nbsp;\u003C\/em\u003Esimplified for my tastes&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t feel like wearing a smart device. I happen to like my gadgets blinking and vibrating and trying to be my best friend. But maybe that&rsquo;s just me.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignnone size-medium_10 wp-image-184702\" alt=\"simple.b-dis-jpg.hac066a998608af0aaf92baee6f31c572\" src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/simple-b-dis-jpg-hac066a998608af0aaf92baee6f31c572.jpeg?w=640&amp;h=94\" width=\"640\" height=\"94\"\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe FitBit\u003C\/b\u003E was straightforward to use and easy to wear, and it has a great user interface in the app. I was especially a fan of the ease with which one can switch from daily reports to overall insights. It also had a great alert system&mdash;it buzzes. I like that user feedback, even if it&rsquo;s just telling me that I&rsquo;ve met my goal for the day. Plus, you can set alarms and notifications, and I found that a buzzing on the wrist was a super effective nap wake-up.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the band (which was pink, for reasons unknown) got dirty very quickly, and started to annoy me after a few days. The little metal clasp used to close the band was particularly irritating, especially in the cold. Interactions with the band could be confusing, too&mdash;you tap the device with varying rapidity to communicate with it, and I frequently made it buzz like crazy just by brushing against it. And all those lights and buzzes made FitBit a hungry beast, needing a charge a couple times a week.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-184703\" alt=\"up24-persimmon-horiz-display\" src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/up24-persimmon-horiz-display.jpg?w=527&amp;h=193\" width=\"527\" height=\"193\"\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Jawbone\u003C\/b\u003E was my favorite overall: It took some getting used to, but the rigid band actually sat better on my wrist than the adjustable straps of the other three. The app was the most fun to use. It felt like a general lifestyle manager, not just a step counter. When you open up the dashboard, everything is there: You can scroll through your daily step summaries ad infinitum, and getting deeper insight into the day is just a tap away.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as I said, the band&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Edid&nbsp;\u003C\/em\u003Etake some getting used to. At first I found the rigidity of it very uncomfortable, and it took a while for me to find the right spot for it to sit on my wrist. One coworker told me that it looked the most like &ldquo;a fashion statement&rdquo; of any of the bands, but another told me that he had gone through three Jawbones and broken them all. And although I liked the game-like interface, some may find the app&rsquo;s features and promptings just a little too &ldquo;friendly&rdquo;.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-184704\" alt=\"Basis_Carbon_Steel_Front_WebRes\" src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/basis_carbon_steel_front_webres.png?w=576&amp;h=248\" width=\"576\" height=\"248\"\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Basis\u003C\/b\u003E seems like a solid device, but ultimately was not for me. A watch-like gadget, it offers the most comprehensive data (even recording a spike in body temperature when I was sick), and feels the most workout-centric of all four devices.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut though it provides the most information, the Basis gives minimal guidance. While the Jawbone offered all kinds of quippy suggestions, the Basis was more businesslike. It could sense much that the other bands couldn&rsquo;t, but that information just became data points to chart. Moreover, the extra sensors (and display) add a lot of extra bulk: The watch face was so large that my wrist got sore. Still, for someone with a larger wrist who&rsquo;s more serious about their athletics, the Basis could very well be the best choice.\u003C\/p\u003E",

This results in the re-allocation of labor of all family members&mdash;those on daily wages lose their income; children may not go to school, and older family members may spend less time in the care of children and infants.&rdquo; And though emergency medical care may not directly prevent injuries from happening, it can certainly prevent them from getting worse.&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/whqlibdoc.who.int\/publications\/2010\/9789241599375_eng.pdf?ua=1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"inline-ad\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s, the United States and other industrialized nations were equally overwhelmed by fatalities from road traffic and work-related injuries. In 1970, the United States suffered \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.saferoads.org\/federal\/2004\/TrafficFatalities1899-2003.pdf\"\u003E52,627 fatalities from motor vehicle collisions alone\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;compared to 32,885 in 2010. Over time, owing to advances in technology and increased political will (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.ems.gov\/pdf\/1997-Reproduction-AccidentalDeathDissability.pdf\"\u003Eprompted by strong pressure from the medical community\u003C\/a\u003E), the wealthiest nations began implementing basic EMS systems to provide care and transport for the critically injured. These systems have helped significantly in reducing premature death and disability from preventable causes. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/Citation\/1997\/07000\/Trauma_Mortality_Patterns_in_Three_Nations_at.61.aspx\"\u003EResults from a widely cited study\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;found that among seriously injured patients in Ghana and Seattle, 81% of deaths in Ghana happened before patients reached the hospital, while in Seattle it was 59%. These difference have very little to do with the advanced trauma care available on Seattle&rsquo;s ambulances, but rather with getting to the hospital quickly.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we break it down, our high tech EMS system is really based around three things: people, vehicles and phones. As the World Bank wrote in a \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.dcp2.org\/file\/219\/dcpp-emergencymedicalservices-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E2008 report on EMS\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;(pdf): &ldquo;Nowhere is the demand for efficient communication and rapid transportation more critical than in emergency medical care. The best teams equipped with state of the art technology and supplies will be wasted if they cannot be reached quickly or if they have no contact with the hospitals where patients are to be taken.&rdquo; An increasing number of &nbsp; initiatives are heeding this advice by experimenting with technologies that essentially crowd-source basic emergency care&mdash;above all for CPR&mdash;including in countries like \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.imedicalapps.com\/2012\/09\/cell-phones-volunteers-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation\/\"\u003ESweden\u003C\/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/israelrescue.org\/\"\u003EIsrael\u003C\/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/pulsepoint.org\/app\/\"\u003Ethe United States\u003C\/a\u003E. However, aside from a few nascent initiatives to harness the potential for these technologies, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/trekmedics.org\/programs\/beacon-field-testing\/\"\u003Eincluding the efforts of my own organization\u003C\/a\u003E, there is minimal discussion among telecom providers to deliver emergency dispatching technologies in the developing world.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting up an effective emergency dispatch system using text messages is as simple as connecting the people who are already helping during emergencies&mdash;like taxi drivers, police, and the ubiquitous youth selling phone minutes on every street corner. Sustainability is possible, too, in the same way it&rsquo;s done in wealthy countries: universal service fees. Every telephone subscriber in the United States pays a fee to the local 911 system in their monthly phone bill. In 2011, Texas was able to&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/transition.fcc.gov\/Daily_Releases\/Daily_Business\/2013\/db0114\/DOC-318391A1.pdf\"\u003Eraise over $200 million dollars\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;through a nominal surcharge for its 911 system. Thus, by simply raising the cost of text messages or voice minutes by only a fraction, sufficient revenue can be generated to maintain an effective dispatch system.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the mobile industry is squarely focused on the next biggest thing, or in the words of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook&rsquo;s CEO, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/mark-zuckerberg-at-mwc-2014-2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Emaking connecting to the internet as easy as dialing 911\u003C\/a\u003E, it would be a mistake to leave such a basic service by the wayside. To do so would be to literally add insult to injury.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWe welcome your comments at&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eideas@qz.com\u003C\/a\u003E. &nbsp;\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E",

The result will be a&nbsp;drop in global oil prices, which would strike a Russian economy centrally reliant on oil and gas exports. It&rsquo;s something the US could do immediately. And given that the SPR currently holds some 700 million barrels of oil, the US could keep up the daily releases for two years or so.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ed_reed\/status\/441544822894370817\"\u003Eargue against\u003C\/a\u003E a release of SPR oil, saying it would hurt not only Russia&mdash;it would harm all oil producers including those in the US. But the US will have to explain to these players that the Ukraine crisis, threatening Europe with changed-borders-at-the-point-of-a-gun, surpasses the importance of the pockets, feelings and profit of oil producing states and companies.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers say that \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.neurope.eu\/article\/lower-oil-prices-won%E2%80%99t-upset-slick-putin\"\u003EPutin would easily weather\u003C\/a\u003E lower oil prices. The issue though is not simply lower prices, but \u003Ci\u003Esustained\u003C\/i\u003E lower prices. That is, Putin would certainly weather a short, temporary plunge in prices. But if he were convinced that he faced low prices for a two-year period or longer, he probably would be pushed to the negotiating table\u003Cstrong\u003E. \u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn oil-led strategy would have to be carried out in tandem with Saudi Arabia so that it does not cut its supplies in order to prop up prices&ndash;and it is a good bet that the Kingdom would go along. True, the Saudis are angry with the US over its failure to act more forcefully on Syria. But they&rsquo;re more furious at Putin, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s greatest international ally.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUS leaders are correct that energy is the best means to strike at Putin. But the precise weapon to use is oil.\u003C\/p\u003E",
